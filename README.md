# sfongx-PHP-project

A project that makes use of PHP and JSON with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This
consisted of two parts:

P1: An events calendar implemented using AJAX requests. The HTML, CSS, and
Javascript needed to display a clickable calendar was already provided.

P2: An online file system that allows the uploading, deleting, and viewing
of limited file types and sizes. HTML code from the sample site provided was
used as a starting point. Javascript was used to handle click events
on the page (clicking the delete button, clicking one of the "Upload a file..."
buttons, etc.), while PHP was used to handle file uploads, viewing, deletion,
and file display order on the home page.

Note that these are meant to run on localhost with full read/write permissions.
